- "what_worked" should focus on validated strengths from support that withstood opposition.
- "what_failed" should capture weaknesses exposed by opposition.
- "why_it_happened" should explain causal mechanisms grounded in the factors.
- "how_to_improve" should provide actionable, prioritized recommendations.
- "synthesis" should provide a comprehensive 2-3 paragraph summary integrating all debate insights.
