{"counter_arguments":[{"target_claim":"...","challenge":"...","risk":"..."}]}

Rules:
- Provide 2-4 counter-arguments tied to specific support claims.
- Focus on weaknesses, gaps, alternative explanations, and risks.
- Do not invent new facts; question assumptions and evidence strength.
- Return JSON only. No extra text.
